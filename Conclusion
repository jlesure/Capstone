To enhance member utilization, consider the following strategies:

Transition away from docked bicycles and focus solely on maintaining a fleet comprising classic and electric-assist bikes.
Allocate resources towards establishing start and end stations in areas beyond tourist hubs, prioritizing the top 5 locations identified.
Implement targeted outreach initiatives aimed at local employers, urging them to promote bicycle commuting among their staff.
Intensify marketing efforts in late Spring and early Summer to capitalize on increased summer ridership.
Extend promotional offers to casual riders, incentivizing them to upgrade to full membership status. Concentrate these promotions at the most frequented start and end stations for casual users.
