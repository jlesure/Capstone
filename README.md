Background & Business Question


Launched in 2016, Cyclistic is a successful point-to-point bike-share program consisting of 5,824 geo-tracked bicycles and 692 locking stations across Chicago.

Historically, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy has focused on increasing public awareness and appealing to a broad market. Flexible pricing plans are core to this strategy and three purchasing tiers are currently offered; (1) single-ride, (2) full-day, and (3) annual memberships.

Cyclistic financial analysts have concluded annual members are the most profitable member segment. Cyclistic believes maximizing the number of annual memberships, by converting single-ride and full-day users to annual members will drive revenue growth.

This study seeks to answer the question — how does Cyclistic bicycle use differ between annual members and casual riders?
